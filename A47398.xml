            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe ſutableneſs of a Dedication is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured from the agreeableneſs of the Subject to the Perſon to whom it is directed; If it is to ſue for Defence and Patronage, (which the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermon ſtands in need of, (not for the ſubject matter, but for the weakneſs of the handling of it,) it ought to be laid at the feet of ſuch who are eminent for the Vertue it recommends to the World: Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you are many ways intitled to this <hi>Sermon,</hi> as being firſt compos'd, and Preach'd by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and by yours, (together with the injunctions of the very Worthy, Loyal, and Judicious <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of the <hi>Grand Inqueſt,</hi>) now publiſh'd in Print, yet the Title upon which it offers it ſelf to your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection now is, that you are a perſon of exemplary Loyalty, of ſteady reſolutions for the eſtabliſh'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Church and State, which is the deſign of this diſcourſe to promote and defend.</p>
            <p>Soon after I receiv'd your ſummons, to officiate as your Chaplain the laſt <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> the diſcovery of the late horrid Conſpiracy determin'd my choice of my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<pb facs="tcp:54950:3"/>I plainly ſaw that Lenity was no charm againſt the Witchcraft of Rebellion, and that the factions and reſtleſs Spirits of ſome men in our age, by their Sedition, had made it neceſſary to have Penal Laws, and to have them duly executed; I thought it might be proper therefore to aſſert the neceſſity of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates being inveſted with an irreſiſtible Coercive Power: and foreſeeing alſo that many who meaſure their Religion by their Secular Intereſt, would be ready to comply ſo far as to avoid the penalty of the Laws, but at the ſame time deſpiſe Dominion in their Hearts, and ſecretly ſpeak evil of Dignities; I thought I could not do better ſervice either to them, or the Government, than by laying open this their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, in ſetling Obedience upon the only ſure and right foundation, the principle of Conſcience, which will engage us to be hearty and ſincere in our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to our Governours, in all times and places.</p>
            <p>This is the great ſecurity that the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> gives to the <hi>Powers of the World;</hi> and this argument the ancient <hi>Apologiſts</hi>

            <p>And herein alſo the <hi>Church of England</hi> (above others) has declared her ſelf to be truly Chriſtian, and
<pb facs="tcp:54950:3"/>ſono Enemy to <hi>Caeſar</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">Act. Rev. Reg. Ed. 6. &amp; Act 37 Reg. Eliz.</note>, by aſſerting the Kings <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> and by requiring our obedience to the Magiſtrate, as ordain'd by God, <hi>not only for wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in this diſcourſe I have endeavour'd not only to expreſs the Character of a good Subject; but of a true Son of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and to ſpeak properly, none can be the latter, but he muſt alſo be the former: And indeed I have ſo great a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for all the doctrines and eſtabliſhments of that Church, that I think it far more eligible (if God ſhould permit it for our ſins) to fall and periſh with it, than by any indirect or unwarrantable means to go about to defend it, or to live and triumph in its ruines. And herein I am confident I expreſs not only my own ſentiments, but yours alſo, and the ſenſe of all the Loyal Nobility and Gentry of our Country, which as it gives place but to few other Countrys for their number and quality, ſo it yields to none for their Loyalty, Unanimity, and Zeal for the eſtabliſh'd Government. I could not doubt therefore but that a diſcourſe of this nature would be grateful both to you and them; and I am ſenſible that your Zeal for the Subject has ſo far biaſs'd your Judgements, as to cauſe you to overlook many f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:54950:4"/>but you aim at the ſame deſign in its Printing for which it was Preach'd; to make men ſenſible, in this reſtleſs and ſeditious Age, of their duty to God and the King, that they cannot truly ſerve the one, unleſs they ſubmit to the other.</p>
            <p>If it may be any ways ſerviceable for theſe great ends, for the promoting of Loyalty, Peace, and Religion with any, eſpecially among thoſe that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has plac'd me with, I ſhall think my pains well beſtow'd; and it will abundantly recompence the cenſures and ill treatment it is like to meet with from thoſe who are obſtinate and irreclaimable.</p>
            <p>That God would ſtrengthen your hands, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper you in your undertakings for his ſervice, and give you all the comforts of this life, and of a better, is the hearty wiſh, and prayer of,</p>

            <p>THe Doctrine of Submiſſion to higher Powers, as it was in an eſpecial manner recommended to the World by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, both by their Precepts and Examples; ſo ought it to be eſteem'd of univerſal obligation, and carefully to be obſerv'd by their followers in all ages: for as there cannot be gather'd either from their words or actions any thing that ſhould limit this duty to any peculiar time or place, ſo they back'd their Injunctions with Reaſons that are perpetual and univerſal, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine <hi>Authority, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and allowing that to be neceſſary, Subjection muſt be ſo too, for they are relative terms, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe each other.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Government</hi> in the general is <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd by any that conſider what the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of an unlimited State would be: We ſee daily even under the confinement of Laws, and where Government is eſtabliſh'd, how difficult it is, notwithſtanding theſe reſtraints, to curb the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of mens Paſſions, to bridle their Luſts, to bring them into any tollerable temper, to make them only more mild and ſociable than Wolves and Tygers: Under all theſe obligation to, and proviſions for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54950:5"/>Peace and Amity, how many are there, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all the bonds of duty and gratitude; maugre all the frowns or ſmiles of Superiours, the Rewards or Puniſhments annex'd to Laws, that fly out againſt their Governours, and their Brethren, that with more than a ſavage cruelty would, and too often do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one another? And if the caſe be ſo under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where there are bounds ſet, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments allotted for Tranſgreſſors, what would be the ſtate and condition of mankind if there were none? If every man were permitted to follow what was juſt in his own eyes, it is to be fear'd, that nothing would ſeem ſo to him, but what was unjuſt, if not cruel to his Neighbour, and confuſion would be the certain conſequence thereof. <hi>Government therefore is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> in it ſelf, ſo is it by the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God,</hi> who has ordain'd it for the good of mankind:<note place="margin">Prov. 8.15. 1 Sam. 26.9. 2 Sam. 5.12.</note> 
               <hi>It is by me</hi> (ſays God) <hi>that Kings reign: They are the Anointed of the Lord: He ſets and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes them in their Thrones.</hi> This he did to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Old Teſtament in a peculiar manner, but he did not confine his care to them only, but <hi>Gentile</hi> Kings are alſo of his appointment, and even ſuch as were Cruel and Tyrannical; as appears from our <hi>Saviours</hi> owning their Power,<note place="margin">Mat. 17.27.22.17, 18, &amp;c.</note> in paying <hi>Tribute</hi> (an Arbitrary Tax) to them, at the expence of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and from the Injunctions of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.2. 1 Pet. 2.13.</note> who command us to <hi>ſubmit to them as the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God,</hi> and <hi>to obey their commands for the Lords ſake. Government</hi> therefore is <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> and at leaſt in the general, of <hi>Divine Appointment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that of all Governments, <hi>Monarchical</hi> is the beſt, will appear from hence, becauſe it bears the neareſt reſemblance to the Divine Government, and

            <p>If we ſuppoſe that Government aroſe from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact from the Conceſſions of the people (which hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis can never be allow'd as true, in regard that Governours are intruſted with a power of Life and Death, which the People never had, and ſo could never grant) ſuppoſing then, but not granting that Government aroſe from Compact, it muſt be allow'd as neceſſary, in order to the attaining of the ends of Government (Peace and Security) that there muſt be a Supream Power, and that Power irreſiſtible. In this caſe, the People muſt be ſuppos'd to concenter in him they place over them, to be Umpire among them, and if they will have him any thing more than the bare Image of a Prince, or expect to enjoy under him the ends of Government, Peace and Security, to him muſt be their final Appeal, and he muſt be inveſted with a power to compell them to ſubmit to his determinations.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, allowing this ſuppoſition of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of Government to be true, yet the deductions which by ſome are made from it, are very inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential: As that the People may reſume the Power which they gave, or at leaſt that thoſe who ſucceed, are not oblig'd to ſtand to the compacts of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; which are not only dangerous Principles, but abſurd and falſe: Nor can it be imagin'd that ever any people ſhould be ſo fooliſh as to go about to build any Government on ſuch a ſandy foundation, which every ſtorm muſt overturn, if the People at pleaſure may reſume their unbounded liberty, which in the foundation of the Government they are ſuppos'd to

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Son's hands more free than the Father's, to oppoſe the eſtabliſh'd Government; for he that is born of a Subject is as much the Prince's, as he that is born of a Slave is the Maſter's right, and he can no more emancipate himſelf than the Son of the Slave can, nor compell his Governour to ſet him free, any more than a Father among the <hi>Romans</hi> could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to manumit his Children, which by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Law is prohibited.<note place="margin">Juſt.

            <p>We ſee then, by the command of God, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Primitive Chriſtians, it was eſteem'd a duty to ſubmit to their Governours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they perſecuted them, and to pray for them. So that the doctrines of depoſing them, of reſiſting, or conſpiring againſt them upon any pretence, is not of Primitive inſtitution, but the Novel Politicks of ſuch who have not the fear of God before their eyes to engage them to pray to him, or of his Vice-gerent upon Earth, to pray for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider the great care and concern of our Governours in protecting us, it ſhould in gratitude oblige us to ſubmit to them, to pray for them, that God would defend and direct them, and eſtabliſh their Thrones.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have had the Protection of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their education, certainly owe ſo much to their Governours, as Obedience to them, to pray for them, to be ready to aſſiſt them with their hearts and hands, in the ſupport of that Government that protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them when they were not able to help themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54950:8"/>
            <p>We are too apt to think that we are not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to our Governours: that no man receives any kindneſs from them but their immediate Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and Courtiers; And ſo we think that we may be excus'd if we pay them no ſervice, ſince we do not reckon our ſelves indebted to them: the moſt of men acknowledging no homage due to any, but what they are immediately paid for, nor have a ſenſe of anyother duty than what is mercenary.</p>
            <p>To ſuch an Hireling as this, I ſay, that the care of thy Governours (although thou deſerv'ſt it not) is extended unto thee. Is thy Life or thy Property of any concern to thee? That thou art ſafe in the one, and ſecure in the other, thou oweſt to the care and goodneſs of thy Governours: For could'ſt thou think either thy Life or thy Eſtate ſafe in the midſt of violence and rapine? And what hinders mens flying out into theſe Villanies but the reſtraint of Laws, which would be but a dead Letter, unleſs thy Governours gave life to them by the execution of them? Is it no kindneſs to thee that thou art yet Maſter of thy own, and not a Slave to a ſtranger? That thou art not devour'd by a foreign force, or an inteſtine Rabble? Our Land is not ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that if it were defenceleſs, no doubt, it would be ſought after, and if the defence were left to our own management, we ſhould not be ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Enemies, nor our ſelves.</p>
            <p>That our days then are prolong'd, and that we enjoy our places, that our Children are not Fatherleſs, and our Wives Widdows, that they are not Vagabonds, forc'd to begg their Bread, that the Extortioner has not all that we have, and that a Stranger does not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs our labours; whom can we, or whom ought we to thank for theſe Bleſſings, but, next under God,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54950:9"/>the Prudence of our King and Governours, in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar adminiſtration of Juſtice, and the wholſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Laws? Certainly ſuch bleſſings as theſe, require in return our ready ſubmiſſion to, and hearty prayers for thoſe under whom we live ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly, and might be more happy in theſe enjoyments if we would our ſelves. The King is the Father of his Country, and the care that he takes for all that are in it is not ſmall: Some men find the Government of a Family to be troubleſome, others experience the burden of adminiſtring of a ſmall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to be heavy; and can we think that the affairs of a whole Kingdom can be manag'd without great watchfulneſs and care?</p>
            <p>We are apt to admire, and to be ſurpriz'd at the brightneſs and glittering gaiety of a Crown, and to think that the Head that wears it muſt needs be free from all pain and trouble. But alas, we know not the weight of the Crown we admire, how it is many times lin'd with Thorns, and preſſes heavy upon the Head of him that wears it; intitles him, as to the homage, ſo to the protection of his people, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt, and ſecure us from foreign force, and domeſtick Conſpiracies.</p>
            <p>If we were acquainted with, and did throughly conſider the troubles and diſquietudes of Princes, the great care they undergo for the good of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the great benefits we enjoy under Government, we ſhould not eſteem our ſelves unconcern'd for them, but account it our indiſpenſable duty to pray for them, and obey them.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Prop.</hi> That although it is neceſſary that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhould have an Abſolute Coercive Power; yet neither the bare hopes of Reward, nor dread of Puniſhment in this Life, ſhould be the only ground
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54950:9"/>of our Obedience. <hi>Ye muſt be ſubject, not only for wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is neceſſary that the Magiſtrate ſhould have an abſolute Coercive power. It is not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſcarcely to be imagin'd, even in a <hi>Platonick</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> Republick, that ever there ſhould be a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men ſo far devoid of all paſſions and ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as readily to ſubmit to their Governours, to obey their Commands, to live in Charity with their Neighbours, and to keep peace with all men, without the proſpect of ſome reward, or fear of ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this life. This Notion of Obedience is too abſtracted for the moſt of men to apprehend, and this Clue of Loyalty ſo ſine ſpun, that it will eaſily be broke, and loſt in the Mazes and Labyrinths of State.</p>
            <p>Good Laws therefore, with ſuitable Sanctions, are neceſſary <hi>in Faece Romuli,</hi> and as they are an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any Government, ſo, when duly executed, they are a ſecurity to it too: For although there may be ſome perſons (as there ought to be many) who may be ſo far in love with Vertue, as to be content to wed her with no other dowry but her own Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who, from a ſenſe of their duty, may continue faithful and obedient unto death, in hopes of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hereafter; yet were there more of this ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temper (as it is to be wiſhed there were) how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable are they to the multitude, who live more by Senſe, than by Reaſon or Faith; whom the innate Beauties and Pleaſures of Vertue can never invite to admire her: who would never deny their luſts, if they could gratifie them without danger, would quickly purſue their Revenge to death, were they not afraid that the Avenger of Blood even in this World would overtake them.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54950:10"/>
            <p>Men may talk of Good Nature, and Right Reaſon; propoſe fair and worthy commendations and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of Vertue, and Honeſty, and Loyalty, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite men to cloſe with them, and poſſibly by theſe motives may perſwade ſome of good underſtandings and honeſt inclinations to do ſo; but ſuch diſcourſes will have as little effect upon the Vulgar, and the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with whom Government has to deal, as fine words upon an unruly Beaſt, which is to be held in with the Bit and Bridle, leſt he fall upon thee; and is to be kept in the right way with no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than with a ſtrait rein, and prudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Whip and Spur.</p>
            <p>If we take away the Laws then, and if they are not duly executed, they are vertually remov'd, we ſhould find that the Vizor of Honeſty and Religion that is now worn by many, would be quickly pull'd off; that Vice would grow bold and impudent, and walk bare-fac'd among us; that Rebellion, and Murder, and open Violence would become the Nations Laws, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe of Peace, Honeſty, and Religion, that would preſently be aboliſh'd: Take away the belief of a Hell, one part of the Sanction of Divine Laws, and I fear that moſt men would quickly forget their duty to their God: and remove the puniſhments from Humane Laws, and they would as ſoon forget that to their Prince and Neighbours too.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore the Rods and Axes that in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſecure the Crown and Scepter; and in this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Age, Guards have been found to be a neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſecurity for the perſons of Princes: The Gibbet and the Pillory are ſerviceable inſtruments for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintenance of Government and Property, for the preſervation of mens Lives, their Names, and their Eſtates.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54950:10"/>
            <p>But allowing all this to be ſo, that good Laws are neceſſary, and that without Temporal Rewards and Puniſhments men would not obey them, yet all this is no more than what the vices of men have made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and it makes no more againſt the other part of the propoſition, than that becauſe the moſt of men are vicious, that therefore it ſhould not be a duty to be vertuous, or that becauſe many men are honeſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a good name, or for fear of puniſhment if they ſhould be otherwiſe, that therefore they ought not to be ſo from a principle of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>To proceed in proof of the ſecond part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, viz. <hi>That neither the barc hopes of a reward, nor dread of puniſhment in this World, ſhould be the only ground of our Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will ſuppoſe at preſent (which we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prove more largely) that Loyalty, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Governours, is a duty that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, and ſo a Chriſtian Grace, and therefore ought to proceed from, and to be meaſur'd by the ſame principle and rule with other Graces, which none will allow to be ſound, if they flow only from a proſpect of Temporal Rewards, or fear of ſuch Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. He therefore that only obeys his Prince out of hopes of being made great by him, or for fear of ſuffering if he ſhould diſobey him, can no more be ſaid to be a good Subject, than he that prays to God only to be ſeen of men, or keeps his hand from picking his Neighbours Pocket, only for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcover'd and diſgrac'd, can be ſaid to be either a good Chriſtian, or an honeſt Man.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if we conſider our Obedience to our Prince as a duty which we owe to God, it cannot be ſuch as will be accepted by him, if it proceeds from fear only; for God requires that we pay thoſe duties
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54950:11"/>we owe to him heartily and ſincerely, with the whole bent of our Will and Affections; but thoſe actions which proceed from fear only, are but<note n="1" place="margin">Ariſt. Eth. ad Nich. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>

               </gap>ay, it may be, deſtructive to the Government, if rely'd upon: For if this Mercenary Subject is defeated in his expectation, or any ways diſpleas'd (as haughty and ambitious men ſoon are at their Governours) or if he have a proſpect of raiſing himſelf with ſafety by Rebelling, what ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch a man, if he purſues his principles, but to oppoſe and deſtroy his King, to advance himſelf, and to overturn the Government, that he may go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd in ſo doing?</p>
            <p>So that from the whole, we ſee that we muſt needs be ſubject <hi>not only for wrath,</hi> for fear of Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, or for hopes of any ſuch Reward, which is not the obedience that God requires, or the King can truſt to, but our Loyalty muſt proceed from a ſenſe of duty, and we muſt obey <hi>for Conſcience-ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The only Obedience that ought to be regarded here, or will be rewarded hereafter, muſt proceed from Conſcience,</p>
            <p>For the right underſtanding of which, we muſt know what Conſcience is, and what it is to act from a principle of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Conſcience is a Power which God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the minds of men, whereby they are enabled to compare their actions with the Rule, and either to approve, or condemn them, as they agree,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54950:11"/>or not agree with the ſame: Now the Rule that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is to be guided by among Chriſtians, is the revealed Will of God: Whatſoever therefore is in Gods Law commanded, is out of Conſcience to be done, and whatſoever is there forbidden, is from the ſame principle to be avoided; and this is to act from a principle of Conſcience, in conformity to what God requires of us: Whatſoever then is not founded in the law of God, nor derivable from thence, is no matter of Conſcience in it ſelf, but of private Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Scrupuloſity, or Errour.</p>
            <p>Now is there any thing in Scripture more plainly commanded than Obedience to Authority, or prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited under ſeverer penalties than the reſiſting of them. To go no further than this Chapter, <hi>Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul be ſubject to the higher Powers, and whoſoever reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and he ſhall receive to himſelf damnation</hi>

            <p>And yet notwithſtanding the plainneſs and ſeverity of theſe Precepts, I know not how it comes to paſs, but ſo it is, that there are many men among us who pretend to walk according to Scripture, and would be accounted the only Conſcientious perſons; yet have no more regard to theſe Rules than if they were Apocryphal to them, and pretend even to Conſcience for the violation of the ſame. They are as free in cenſuring and condemning their Governours, as if it were not written, that<note n="2" place="margin">Exod. 22.28. Acts 23.5.</note>

The King, the higheſt Power, is to be divided, and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may be ſo far ſeparated from his Perſon, as the one may be made uſe of to deſtroy the other When we are expreſly commanded <hi>to ſubmit to the King, and to thoſe that are ſent by him;</hi> and that not only to ſuch as <hi>are good and gentle,</hi> but alſo <hi>to the froward,</hi> and to bear <hi>our ſufferings patiently,</hi> although we ſuffer <hi>wrongfully,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> after <hi>the example of Chriſt;</hi> how many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations muſt we have before theſe precepts (which were deliver'd indefinitely) can be receiv'd or own'd? If the King be Ungracious, Inſufficient, or Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, he is ſo far <hi>(ſay ſome)</hi> from being to be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, that he ought to be oppos'd and deſtroy'd. As if <hi>Nero,</hi> and ſome of thoſe that ſucceeded him, were not as Cruel and Tyrannical, as 'tis imaginable any ſhould be, whom they were commanded to obey, and did quietly ſubmit to. I'm confident that if the like Sophiſtry were allow'd to be made uſe of in other caſes, the force of any the plaineſt precepts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be eluded, and the moſt deſperate actings by ſuch Arts might be defended thence. But however men by ſuch devices may delude themſelves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the World, yet God will not be mocked, nor their Conſciences always ſleep, but will one day try them, and unleſs they repent, condemn them by theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54950:12"/>plain Scripture Rules, devoid of all their Sophiſtry and deluſion.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he that makes Conſcience of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Governours, dares not ſo much as curſe them in his thought, much leſs enter into any Leagues, Covenants, or Aſſociations againſt them, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſecret, becauſe his Conſcience, which is the foundation of his Obedience, reſpects a future judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he obeys his Ruler, as the Miniſter of God, ſo that although his Treaſonable thought may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from the one, yet he knows it cannot eſcape the knowledge and judgement of the other. This is the greateſt ſecurity that any Prince can have from any Subject, that he looks upon Obedience as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty commanded by God, and that ſo long as he has the fear of God before his eyes, he cannot but reverence his Vicegerent upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Where Allegiance is founded on Religion, and Loyalty proceeds from Conſcience, it is the ſame in all times and places; it commands our Prayers for the King, and thoſe in Authority, in private as well as publick; that we neither reproach them ſecretly in their proſperity, nor revile them openly in their adverſity; that we be ready with our Hands and Purſes, with our Lives and Fortunes, to eſtabliſh the Throne, to oppoſe the Enemies of God, and the King: This is that Obedience which deſerves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement here, but (if attended with other Vertues) will certainly meet with a reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

            <p>Men may pretend to a ſenſe of Honour, of Moral Gallantry and Honeſty, that may ſecure them from the violations of Natural Laws, and the Laws of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and that this may render them as capable of being good Subjects and good Men, as the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of an over ruling Deity, and all the Sanctions of Divine Laws, and terrours of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I would only ask this queſtion of ſuch <hi>Moraeliſts,</hi> What is the chief end they propoſe to themſelves? for every man muſt have ſome ultimate end to which all his actions are to be directed: Now theſe perſons deny any thing of futurity, and ſo it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here. Is it therefore either Honour, Riches, or Pleaſure? (the ſumm of what this World affords) which ſoever then of theſe is the end propos'd, all things are to be directed to it, and what ſhould hinder ſuch a Perſon from committing the greateſt impiety, rather than be defeated of his end?</p>
            <p>If Honour or Popular Applauſe be the end they aim at, and if they ſuppoſe (as too many of late have thought) that the ready way to it is by oppoſing the King, and ruining the Church and State, who knows whether they may not (with <hi>Brutus</hi>) purſue it, to the expulſion of the King, and overthrow of the Monarchy, or may not kindle a fire in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54950:13"/>the Temple (with <hi>Eroſtratus</hi>) to get a name?</p>
            <p>If riches be the game they hunt after, what ſhould hinder them from running upon deſperate attempts to enrich themſelves, and to repair or increaſe their fortunes (if they have opportunity) out of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſuries, to become Robbers of God and the King, to enrich themſelves, ſince they deny the Being of the one, I know nothing that can ſecure from them (if they have power) the Prerogative or Poſſeſſions of the other?</p>
            <p>If Pleaſure be their Deity, and they are wholly devoted to it, what ſhould keep them from ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all things which ſtand in their way to it? This renders men of ſuch tempers not only uſeleſs, but dangerous to any Society; for if the Government ſhould be uneaſie to them, put any reſtraint upon them in this particular, what ſhould hinder them (if they have conveniency) from endeavouring to caſt off the Reſtraint and the Government together, in hopes of more Liberty, more Pleaſure in another?</p>
            <p>If we propoſe theſe queſtions to an Atheiſt, and preſs him to declare the ultimate end of his actions, and the firſt principle of his Obedience to his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, if he ſettles not upon the apprehenſions of a God, and the dictates of Conſcience; he muſt at laſt bottom either on Self-intereſt, or on Chance and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualty, for his Obedience; and how far ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, acting from ſuch principles, are to be truſted, may be gather'd from what hath been ſaid, and has alſo too lately, and too dearly been experienc'd, than ever (I hope) to be rely'd upon again.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he that profeſſes he knows God, but in his works denies him, is abominable and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent too: The Practical Atheiſt is little leſs dangerous to Government than the Speculative one: He that in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54950:14"/>words owns the Being of a God, but at the ſame time dare live as if there were none, may be ready, with the Traytor <hi>Judas</hi> (who bore the like badge of profeſſion) to ſeize his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> with a <hi>Hail Maſter,</hi> and <hi>betray him with a Kiſs.</hi>

            <p>I have not time, neither would it be needful, if I had, to anſwer particularly all that is alledg'd againſt this poſition, by thoſe Champions for a pretended Conſcience againſt the lawful power of Magiſtrates, and that uſe their miſtaken liberty for a cloak of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs.

            <p>But if this Doctrine were true, what Prince could be ſafe in the Throne, or what People quiet and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in their enjoyments? How many good Princes (ſome as juſt and righteous as ever held a Scepter) have been branded with one, or all theſe marks, by reſtleſs and ſeditious Spirits? What action of State can be ſo order'd, that either Ignorance or Malice will not bring under one of theſe heads?

But bleſſed be God, the true Religion allows of no ſuch practices, he that looks into the Goſpel, will find that our <hi>Saviour</hi> has told us, that his Kingdom was not of this World, that the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he eſtabliſh'd was a meek, peaceable, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, promiſing eſpecial rewards to thoſe who leave Houſes or Lands to lay down their lives for Chriſt's ſake: It ſets before us the example of our Saviour, who was made perfect through ſufferings, and we are commanded to follow his example, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſuffering for the truth, if it pleaſe God to call us to it.</p>
            <p>As this was the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſo I have ſhewn you that it was the practice of the firſt Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, and their ſucceſſors; they never knew what it was in the Primitive times of Chriſtianity, to oppoſe, expell, or deſtroy any Pagan, Perſecuting, <hi>Arrian,</hi> or Apoſtate Emperour; they knew not yet what it was to take up other Arms againſt their Governours, than their Prayers and their Tears, that they might live peaceably and quietly under them, in Godlineſs and Honeſty<note n="1" place="margin">Greg.

            <p>But how different is this from the carriage of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in our days, who would be thought to be the ſtricteſt, if not the only followers of Chriſt, whoſe pretences to Religion make way to Rebellion, and their Faith intitles them to Faction.</p>

            <p>If S. <hi>Paul</hi> had wrote after their manner, or to pleaſe them, he muſt have chang'd the ſtile of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and inſtead of commanding <hi>to ſubmit,</hi> have perſwaded them to be ſtubborn, and diſobedient <hi>for Conſcience-ſake,</hi> inſtead of <hi>exhorting them to make Prayers and Supplications for Kings, and all in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> that they enter into <hi>Leagues, Covenants, Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi> againſt them, and under a ſhew of Religion, deſtroy thoſe that would live peaceably and quietly in the Land.</p>
            <p>To ſubmit, after the example of our Saviour, <hi>ſay they,</hi> would be the ready way to be deſtroy'd, and Prayers and Tears, the ancient Chriſtian Armour againſt Perſecutors, are now no better than <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank Receipts,</hi> as the late <hi>Apoſtate Author of the Life of</hi> (his elder Brother) <hi>Julian,</hi> calls them, (terms fit only for a Scaffold or a Pillory, and might from thence well enough ſound from the Author, better, I'm ſure, than from the Preſs or Pulpit,) theſe Receipts, <hi>ſay they,</hi> are now ineffectual to cure the diſtempers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore they hope they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed if they uſe ſome more violent remedies, and deſtroy the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> to eſtabliſh <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> (which they call Godlineſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion). Nay furthermore, the ſame Author and his Party tell us, and we are beholden to them for the diſcovery (for it is a Mine newly ſprung againſt the Government) that we have Law on our ſides now, and 'tis current doctrine with them, that where the King perſecutes againſt Law, he may be oppos'd and deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which vain and impious Plea (for ſo it has been fully made appear to be, in the Life of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>) I would propoſe this <hi>dilemma</hi> to ſuch perſons, who think they may reſiſt, if a good Authority Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes

He did not want ſtrength, for he could with a word ſpeaking have called down Power enough from Heaven to have deſtroy'd his Perſecutors againſt Law; and certainly if he intended any ſuch liberty for Chriſtians, he would not have given ſuch an example by his ſufferings to the contrary, and oblig'd all his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.24, 25.

            <p>So that upon the whole we muſt conclude, that either our <hi>Saviour</hi> died as a Malefactor, according to Law, or elſe that he ſuffering againſt Law, did too tamely ſubmit, betray'd his followers, and his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not to be imitated by us; either of which are little leſs than blaſphemous, and fit for none but a <hi>Julian,</hi> or the <hi>Author of his Life</hi> to affirm. And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the Propoſitions and Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries.</p>
            <p>What remains? But that we all apply our ſelves to endeavour the ſupport of the Government, and in our ſeveral places and ſtations ſtudy to keep a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and faithfully to diſcharge that truſt which God and the King have committed to us: You, <hi>my Lords,</hi> and <hi>All that are in Authority,</hi> by a ſteady and impartial execution of Juſtice, and all of us by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious ſubmiſſion to our Prince, and obedience to his Laws.</p>
            <p>Let us be thankful to God, who has eſtabliſh'd ſo juſt and rightful a <hi>Government</hi> among us, and hath ſet ſo gracious a <hi>Prince</hi> to rule over us, who as he had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54950:16"/>greater injuries than any of his Predeceſſors to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, ſo God endued him with a Clemency fitted for the ſame: Although he might juſtly have reſented the evil carriage of his Subjects towards him in the days of his Exile, yet at his return he was ready to forget all, to receive them as Friends, who had been ſo bitter Enemies, and in much mercy to forgive them more than they could expect or deſerve; God grant that they may be truly ſenſible of it, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obedient to God and the King for it. He ſtill treats his Subjects with the kindneſs of a Father: Whoſe Oxe hath he taken? Whoſe Vineyard hath he coveted? Or whom doth he in any kind oppreſs? He is pleas'd to oblige himſelf to walk by the ſame Law with his Subjects, and if at any time he ſteps beſide it, of his own motion, 'tis to abate the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſeverity of it: And indeed the yoak of his Government is ſo eaſie and gentle, that it tempts ſome, <hi>I fear,</hi> to grow wanton under ſo light a burden, and to endeavour to caſt it off from their Necks: Strange it is, that men ſhould be ſo careleſs and diſingenuous as to neglect to be thankful for, nay, to abuſe both God's and the King's mercies, by ſinning againſt the one, and by murmuring and conſpiring againſt the other.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, if we are ſenſible of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we enjoy in the liberty of the true Reform'd Religion, in oppoſition to Superſtition and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if we are truly ſenſible of the bleſſings of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in general, in oppoſition to Anarchy; of a good and gracious Government, in oppoſition to Tyranny; let us be heartily thankful to God, who has wonderfully deliver'd our <hi>King</hi> from the hands of violent and bloody men, <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd againſt him; that he has hitherto preſerv'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54950:17"/>his <hi>Church</hi> from the inſolent incurſions of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Profaneneſs,</hi> and the whole Kingdom from <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Devaſtation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore Decency and Order in the Church and State, be better than Anarchy and Confuſion; If Liberty and Property be better than Oppreſſion and Tyranny; If Peace be better than War, and Life than Death, let us be thankful and Obedient, that it may be well with us, and our Poſterity. <hi>Let us fear God and the King, and meddle not with thoſe that are given to change: let Judgment run down like water, and Righteouſneſs like a mighty ſtream;</hi> that the Throne may be eſtabliſh'd, our Religion defended, our Lives ſecur'd, and our Peace continu'd. And let us all in an eſpecial manner put up our hearty <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> to God <hi>for the King, and for all that are in Authority;</hi> that God would direct, and defend them, and <hi>that under them we may lead peaceable and quiet lives, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi>
